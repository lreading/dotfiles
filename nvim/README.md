# Neovim Config

This is largely based on [ThePrimeagen's 0 to LSP Neovim Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).  There are a small number of things I've changed to suit my needs.  I'm by no means a neovim expert: at the time of writing, I'm just starting to use it to see if it will work for me long-term.  You've been warned!
